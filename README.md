# Text_Based_Bank
This application is developed with the help of JAVA and ECLIPSE IDE .

This application will be able to model real life bank functions such as adding an account, increasing/decreasing the balance of an account, and allowing a user to check their balance. We will also learn how to store basic demographic information of each account holder and learn how to output a summary of all accounts. 
This application will demonstrate standard programming paradigms, and has taught me about essential programming concepts such as variables, commenting, input and output to the user with the Scanner class, and importing/using standard Java libraries.I have also covered more powerful concepts such as conditional statements, loops, and arrays.
